# Project: Stock Project Using Streamlit
Overview: Welcome to the Streamlit stock project. This project is my first attempt at using Streamlit and it was very successful. The project shows different stocks and uses the log of those stocks so we can analyze those stocks using the same baseline to see which stock improved the most. 

Streamlit is a program that makes an interactive dashboard. Using this dashboard, I can show stakeholders which stocks are making money and which are not.

Improvements:
  - I would like to do a forecast on these stocks to predict where they are going in the future and show that in a faint line after actual stock values.
  - I would like to add more stocks to the field so that the user can choose from a much larger variety of stocks.
  - I would like to clean up the dashboard so it looks a little cleaner and feature it on a website.
